# ahk_archive
My archive of ahk scripts I made

## Requirements
- [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

## Adding to startup
1. Open run (WinKey + R)
2. Type `shell:startup`
3. Put the script inside there
4. Done âœ¨

## Recommended setup
Best experience would be to `git clone` this project and make a shortcut to the scripts inside the startup folder.
You then get the custom icons to the script and can actually see the difference between each program, lol.

## Self notes, yes yes
Debug keyboard buttons, add at top: `#InstallKeybdHook`
